# Flowers Shop

The owner of a Flower Shop wants an app which will help to keep on top of the store inventory.

This is not an app that customers will see, but will be used to check stock levels and see what needs to be ordered soon.

You should be able to add stock, which would have an Flowers and Plants as well as the quantity available.

### MVP:
```
[x] Create flowers with the quantity that are in stock

[x] Create plants

[x] Show an inventory page listing flowers and plants

[] Show a stock level for the inventory items e.g. High/Medium/Low
```

### Possible Extensions:

[x] Add a buy and sell price to each stock item

[x] Calculate the possible markup on items and show on inventory page

[] Add a type to an Flowers and Plants

[] Any other ideas you might come up with
